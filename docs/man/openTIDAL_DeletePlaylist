.SH NAME
openTIDAL_DeletePlaylist, openTIDAL_DeletePlaylistItem \- Manipulate playlists
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <openTIDAL/openTIDAL.h>

.BI "const int openTIDAL_DeletePlaylist (openTIDAL_SessionContainer *session, const char *playlistId);"

.BI "const int openTIDAL_DeletePlaylistItem (openTIDAL_SessionContainer *session, const char *playlistId, const int index);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The openTIDAL_DeletePlaylist family of service functions deletes an artefact from a playlist or deletes the complete playlist.
Different from the openTIDAL_Get* service functions, only the parsed status gets returned.
These functions are not available in the restricted client-id authorisation mode
(\fIopenTIDAL_SessionInit(3)\fP).

Despite the convenience of adding multiple artefacts to a playlist at once, one can only delete a single artefact per
function call. This is a limitation by the TIDAL API.

To delete an artefact in a playlist specify the position of the artefact with the index parameter.
A playlist starts from 0.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBlibopenTIDAL\fP(3) has a global set of specified returned values implemented.
Not only are the HTTP response-codes part of the parsing but also TIDALs own
API status and sub-status codes. An accurate status of the http request/response
gets returned.
