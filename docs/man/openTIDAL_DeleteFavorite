.SH DESCRIPTION
The openTIDAL_DeleteFavorite family of service functions deletes artefacts from the users content collection.
Different from the openTIDAL_Get* service functions, only the parsed status gets returned.
These functions are not available in the restricted client-id authorisation mode
(\fIopenTIDAL_SessionInit(3)\fP).

To delete an artefact from the collection, call the correct service function that represents the type of the
artefact.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBlibopenTIDAL\fP(3) has a global set of specified returned values implemented.
Not only are the HTTP response-codes part of the parsing but also TIDALs own
API status and sub-status codes. An accurate status of the http request/response
gets returned.
